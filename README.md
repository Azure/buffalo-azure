# Buffalo-Azure

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/buffalo-azure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/buffalo-azure)

By extending [gobuffalo](https://gobuffalo.io), we seek to empower rapid web developers to deploy to Azure easily, and even generate code that will integrate well with Azure services.

#### provision

`buffalo azure provision [flags]`

It's fun to tinker with a website locally, but at some point you've got to get it hosted. Use the provision command to create the necessary infrastructure and services to run your website on Microsoft's Cloud. All you need is to use the Dockerfile already generated by Buffalo to create an image that will be run in an [Azure Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/containers/).

#### eventgrid

`buffalo generate eventgrid {name} [flags]`

[Azure Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/overview) is an HTTP based messaging solution, that seeks to empower you while writing event-driven reactive web applications. Many Azure Services are already wired up to start informing you when their events happen using Event Grid.

Running this command will add an action to your buffalo application that can be registered with an Event Grid Topic. It automatically responds to Subsctiption Validation events, and dispatches to different methods based on the Event Type string in an Event definition.

### Installation

This is an extension, so before you install Buffalo-Azure, make sure you've already [installed Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io/en/docs/installation).

#### Build from Source
##### option 1 - go get  

The easiest, albeit least stable, way to get started is to use `go get`.
``` bash
go get -u github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure
```

##### option 2 - git clone

> [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep) is a pre-requisite for these installation instructions.

Building yourself isn't too arduous, and enables a reproducible build stamped with the git revision you're using.

``` bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure
git clone https://github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure.git .
dep ensure
go install -ldflags "-X github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure/cmd.version=$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
``` 

#### Binary Distribution

This isn't supported yet, but if you'd like to see it, go get it moved up our backlog by thumbs-uping or commenting on [Azure/buffalo-azure#37](https://github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure/issues/37).

## Disclaimer
This is an experiment by the Azure Developer Experience team to expand our usefulness to Go developers beyond generating SDKs. 
**This is not officially supported** by the Azure DevEx team, Azure, or Microsoft.
