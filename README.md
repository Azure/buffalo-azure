# Buffalo-Azure

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/buffalo-azure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/buffalo-azure)

This is an experiment by the Azure Developer Experience team to expand our usefulness to Go developers beyond generating SDKs. 
**This is not officially supported** by the Azure DevEx team, Azure, or Microsoft.

By extending [gobuffalo](https://gobuffalo.io), we seek to empower rapid web developers to deploy to Azure easily, and even generate code that will integrate well with Azure services.

## Installation

``` bash
go get -u github.com/Azure/buffalo-azure
```
