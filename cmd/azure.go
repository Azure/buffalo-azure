// azureCmd represents the azure command
var azureCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "azure",
	Short: "Exposes tools for more easily using Azure services.",
	Long: `Updates your application to get started with Azure services.

The most common types of operations are:
  - Adding configuration to host your application in Azure.
  - Updating routes in your application to do handshakes with Azure services.`,
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
	//	fmt.Println("azure called")
	// },
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(azureCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// azureCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// azureCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
